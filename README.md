# Car-Rental-Business-Simulator
Object Oriented Program to model a car rental business

## Team
1. Harshit Hajela (haha4350)
2. Nikhil Jain (nija5462)
3. Anusha Gupta (angu5645)

## Instructions

## Language and Environment
Java8 and Eclipse IDE and IntelliJ IDEA

## Steps to Run
Run first app.java for the Simulation
Then Run MyUnitTest.java for the Test cases.

For Testcases, we have written MyUnitTest class which needed to run separately. Unit Test cases should be run separately, so that everytime someone makes a change they can be run. The main code will never call the Test methods.
